CMFD: 3-D Multigroup Diffusion Solver
=====================================

CMFD is a Coarse Mesh Finite Difference three-dimensional multigroup diffusion 
solver.  It is capable of predicting the three-dimensional multigroup flux 
distribution over a structured Cartesian mesh provided diffusion parameters 
are given.  Although stand-alone here, this code was developed for integeration with Monte Carlo-based neutron transport codes to accelerate core calculations.

The development of CMFD began at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology`_ 
within the `Computational Reactor Physics Group`_.
